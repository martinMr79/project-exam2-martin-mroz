## Technical Information

Holidaze is developed using approved, modern technologies, ensuring robust performance and scalability. The application is built on the React JavaScript framework, coupled with a CSS framework for responsive and appealing design. It uses the Holidaze API for all functionalities, making it a front-end application only.

The application is hosted on Netlify, a popular static host known for its reliability and speed.

## Design and Planning Tools

For designing the user interface and user experience, we used Figma, a popular design application that allows for interactive prototyping.

Our project planning was carried out using Trello, a web-based Kanban-style list-making application. We used a Gantt chart for project timing.
